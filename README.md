👋 About Me
<br>Hi, I’m Baptiste Lonqueu — a former telecom technician now transitioning into cybersecurity. I’m currently enrolled in the intensive full-time program at Holberton School, where I’m building strong foundations in:

<br><br>- Low-level programming (C, Shell)
<br><br>- System and network security
<br><br>- Web infrastructure and backend development
<br><br>- Web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

<br><br>🔐 I’m passionate about protecting digital systems and continuously learning how to identify, mitigate, and respond to security threats.
<br><br>📌 Currently looking for a cybersecurity apprenticeship to apply my skills in a real-world environment and grow as a security professional.
